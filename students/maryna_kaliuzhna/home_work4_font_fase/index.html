            <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup <br>
                instructions, they've moved to <ins>their own section</ins>. Continue reading for an introduction to the
                <br>
                documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

            <h3>CORE COMPONENTS</h3>
            <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and <br>
                the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs
                <br>
                APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <i>bundles
                    <br>
                    of reusable, nestable code</i>. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs
                cover <br>
                how components work in React Native.

            <h3> <b>REACT FUNDAMENTALS</b> </h3>
            <p>React Native runs on <ins>React</ins>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                <br>
                JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get
                <br>
                you started or can serve as a refresher course.
            </p>
            <p> We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
            <p> <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, <br>
                approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
            <p> <b>+ JSX. </b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
                like so: <br>
                <mark> &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;&frasl;Text&gt;.</mark>
            </p>
            <p>The React docs have <ins> a comprehensive guide to JSX</ins> you can refer to learn even more. Because
                JSX is <br>
                JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <mark>name</mark> for the cat,
                name, and <br>
                embedding it with curly braces inside <mark>&lt;Text&gt;</mark></p>
            <p> <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
            <p> <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,
                <br>
                state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                <br>
                time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
            </p>

        <div> <sub>Chapter 4</sub>
            <h3><b>YANDLING TEXT INPUT</b> </h3>
            <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <i>onChangeText</i> prop that
                <br>
                takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a <br>
                function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.
                <br>
                In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there <br>
                Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
